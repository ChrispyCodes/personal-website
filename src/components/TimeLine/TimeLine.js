        I consider myself a creative person and thats why I like coding, because
        anything that I have an idea for I can create it. I started coding after
        I had shoulder surgery when I was 18, I couldn't do much else. Coding
        was the perfect hobby for sitting on my üçë.

        Why do I code now? My aim is to make a positive impact in peoples
        lives...building software that adds a bit of joy to life rather than
        robbing you of it. Outside of coding, I am passionate about music. I'm a
        huge fan of chillstep, its timeless. I listen to loads of comedy
        podcasts, Joey diaz is TREMENDOUS! Also, spending time in nature with my
        aussie is a beautiful thing &#127925; &#127794;
