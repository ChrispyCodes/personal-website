        I consider myself a creative person and thats why I like coding, because
        anything that I have an idea for I can create it. I started coding after
        I had shoulder surgery when I was 18, I couldn't do much else. Coding
        was the perfect hobby for sitting on my üçë. I ended up going to
        community college for a year while working at Starbucks and then
        transferred to ASU online through Starbucks' tuition reimbursement
        program. History repeated itself, I got injured and had to take a break
        from school. So, I ended up going to a coding bootcamp called The Tech
        Academy in Portland, OR. I graduated in June 2018 and started my first
        dev job in July 2018 as as an instructor at The Tech Academy. I taught
        full-stack web development there until I was hired as a developer on a
        contract working on a late stage project for the state. After that was
        over I was hired as a full-stack developer at a company called OnPoint
        Community Credit Union(OCCU). I worked there for just under 3 years
        using C#, .NET Core, JS, and SQL Server everyday. After I left OCCU I
        took some time off amid the pandemic and then started working on my own
        projects and learning new technologies that I can use to build better
        software. Now Im looking for a new opportunity to work with a team of
        developers that are passionate about what they do and are looking to
        make a positive impact in the world.

        Outside of coding, I am passionate about music. I'm a huge fan of
        chillstep, it's timeless. I listen to loads of comedy podcasts, Joey
        diaz is TREMENDOUS! Also, spending time in nature with my aussie is a
        beautiful thing &#127925; &#127794;
